# Reproducible Analysis and Documentation with R and RStudio

Make your research life easier with the tools of reproducible research! In "Reproducible Analysis and Documentation with RStudio and R Markdown," we will focus primarly on two workflow-tools. First, we briefly review RStudio Projects to create a project-oriented workflow in your R scripts. Second, we use R Markdown for literate programming. We will review R Markdown documents, which you can use to write complete papers. We will take a look at the new features in Visual R Markdown, such as citations and technical writing.

This is the third of our four-session series “Reproducible Research Practices: Make Your Research Life Easier.”  Other sessions include "Organize Your Files and Metadata for Transparent and Reproducible Research," "Version Control with GitHub," and "Sharing Your Data for Transparent and Reproducible Research."

## Prep

- Before the first session, make sure you have installed or updated R and RStudio [Installing and updating instructions are here](https://jennhuck.github.io/workshops/install_update_R.html). For best participation results, make sure you have updated RStudio to 1.4. 
- Visit my [GitHub Penguins repository](https://github.com/jennhuck/penguins/) and download the repository. This repository contains files for a demo project. Click on the big green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP," and save it somewhere that you can find on the day of the workshop and unzip the folder.

## Follow Along

Use the [slides](https://jennhuck.github.io/reproAnalysis/slides/repro_analysis_R_RStudio-slides.html#1) to follow along.  You will create a simple RStudio Project (worms).  You will also use the Penguins demo project to review RStudio Projects.  Continue using the Penguins demo project and follow along with the R Markdown file there.
